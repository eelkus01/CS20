            <h2>Computer Science Major</h2>
            <p>IP Address: 10.243.19.89.</p>
            <p>I grew up in Birmingham, AL.</p>
            <p><img src="IMG_8602.jpg" alt="Lake House" style="width:400px;" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="10">
                My favorite place to be is my grandmother's lake house in Alabama.
                It's very calm and peaceful and a very fun place to be with my cousins
                and sisters, especially in the summer. You can see a picture of the lake to the left.</p>
            <p>One of my favorite restaurants is Dave's Fresh Pasta in Davis Square.
                They have amazing sandwiches!
                <a href="https://www.davesfreshpasta.com/" target="_blank">Here</a>
                is a link to their website.</p>
            <p>Something no one would expect about me is that I have watched every episode of Riverdale to date.</p>
